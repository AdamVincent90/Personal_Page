            <p class="font-italic">Firstly, thank you for visiting my website, my name is Adam and I am a graduate from the University
                of Northampton as of 2020. I am a keen admirer of learning, no matter the age, this is one reason I
                    love web development, always something new to learn, challenge to overcome, and skills to improve. I am currently
                        learning Laravel (this website is built using knowledge learned on Udemy (Thank you Edwin Diaz!) to further
                            improve my skills in web development, and most importantly, find my dream role as a developer.
                                Again, Thank you for visiting, and have a great day :)! Adam.</p>
